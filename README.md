# Flipper - Quick Overview
AlbionFlipper is a Black Market flipping tool for the sandbox MMORPG Albion Online.

AlbionFlipper uses data collected by [The Albion Online Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/) to compare prices of buy orders in the [Black Market](https://wiki.albiononline.com/wiki/Black_Market?crf=3AYZB3G7UG&utm_source=pmax&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2PM&gclid=Cj0KCQiAifz-BRDjARIsAEElyGICyl2-9OlfLx1Uqnkg4dQPwsEvhM6YWQcnx-S_M4Un9ZQ2JPpYarwaAhP9EALw_wcB) in Caerleon with sell orders in the markets of royal cities and Caerleon. It displays items that have a higher buy order price in the BM than the sell order in one of the cities, which basically means that if you buy that item from that city and sell in on the BM, you will make a profit.
